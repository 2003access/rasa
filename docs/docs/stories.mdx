description: Stories are used to teach Rasa real conversation designs to learn from providing the basis for a scalable machine learning dialogue management.
abstract: Stories are one way (rules are the other) to train your assistant's dialogue management model. Rasa uses stories to train your model and enable it to respond to conversations it doesn't already have in its training data.

## Format

All Rasa training data is written using YAML, you can learn more about using YAML in the [Training Data Format](./training-data-format.mdx) page.

A Rasa story describes a conversation between a user and an AI assistant, in a format where user inputs are expressed as intents (and entities when necessary), while the assistant's actions are expressed as action names.

Here's an example of a conversation in the story format that will be explained below:

```yaml-rasa
stories: 
- story: collect restaurant booking info  # name of the story - just for debugging
  steps: 
  - intent: greet                         # user message with no entities
  - action: utter_ask_howcanhelp
  - intent: inform                        # user message with no entities
    entities:
    - location: "rome"
    - price: "cheap" 
  - action: utter_on_it                  # action that the bot should execute
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine 
  - intent: inform
    entities:
    - cuisine: "spanish"
  - action: utter_ask_num_people
```

### User Messages

In stories, you describe a user's input using intents and entities that Rasa's NLU will predict based on your users' messages.

```yaml-rasa {6-9}
stories: 
- story: collect restaurant booking info  # name of the story - just for debugging
  steps: 
  - intent: greet                         # user message with no entities
  - action: utter_ask_howcanhelp
  - intent: inform                        # user message with no entities
    entities:
    - location: "rome"
    - price: "cheap" 
  - action: utter_on_it                  # action that the bot should execute
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine 
  - intent: inform
    entities:
    - cuisine: "spanish"
  - action: utter_ask_num_people
```

If you expect your user messages to contain entities, you should include them in your stories so that your model can predict the next action based on the *combination* of both the intent and entities.

### Actions

All actions executed by the assistant, including [responses](./responses.mdx) are listed
in stories under the `action` key.

You can use a response from your domain as an action by listing it as one 
in a story. Similarly, you can indicate that a story should call a custom action by including
the name of the custom action from the `actions` list in your domain.


### Events

During training, Rasa Open Source does not call the action server. This means
that your assistant's dialogue management model doesn't know which events a custom
action will return. 

Because of this, events such as setting a slot or activating/deactivating a form have to be
explicitly written out as part of the stories. You can read more about 
the different types of events [here](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server/events).

#### Slot Events

Slot events are written under `slot_was_set` in a story. If this slot is set
inside a custom action, add the `slot_was_set` event immediately following the
custom action call. If your custom action resets a slot value to `None`, the
corresponding event for that would look like this: 

```yaml-rasa {6-7}
stories:
- story: set slot to none 
  steps:
    # ... other story steps 
    - action: my_custom_action
    - slot_was_set:
        my_slot: null
```

#### Form Events

There are three kinds of events that need to be kept in mind while dealing with
forms in stories.

* A form action event (e.g. `- action: restaurant_form`) is used in the beginning when first starting a form, and also while resuming the form action when the form is already active.

* A form activation event (e.g. `- active_loop: restaurant_form`) is used right after the first form action event.

* A form deactivation event (e.g. `- active_loop: null`), which is used to deactivate the form.

:::note writing form stories
In order to get around the pitfall of forgetting to add events, the recommended
way to write these stories is to use [interactive learning](./writing-stories.mdx#using-interactive-learning).

## Checkpoints and OR statements

Checkpoints and OR statements should be used with caution, if at all.
There is usually a better way to achieve what you want by using [Rules](./rules.mdx) or
[retrieval actions](./retrieval-actions.mdx).

### Checkpoints

You can use checkpoints to modularize and simplify your training
data. Checkpoints can be useful, but **do not overuse them**. Using
lots of checkpoints can quickly make your example stories hard to
understand, and will slow down training.

Here is an example of stories that
contain checkpoints:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: beginning of flow
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: action_ask_user_question
  - checkpoint: check_asked_question

- story: handle user affirm
  steps:
  - checkpoint: check_asked_question
  - intent: affirm
  - action: action_handle_affirmation
  - checkpoint: check_flow_finished

- story: handle user deny
  steps:
  - checkpoint: check_asked_question
  - intent: deny
  - action: action_handle_denial
  - checkpoint: check_flow_finished

- story: finish flow
  steps:
  - checkpoint: check_flow_finished
  - intent: goodbye
  - action: utter_goodbye
```

:::note
Unlike regular stories, checkpoints are not restricted to starting with
user input. As long as the checkpoint is inserted at the right points
in the main stories, the first event can be a custom action or a response
as well.

:::

### Or Statements

Another way to write shorter stories, or to handle multiple intents
the same way, is to use an `or` statement. For example, if you ask
the user to confirm something, and you want to treat the `affirm`
and `thankyou` intents in the same way. The story below will be
converted into two stories at training time:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: 
  steps: 
  # ... previous steps 
  - action: utter_ask_confirm
  - or: 
    - intent: affirm
    - intent: thankyou
  - action: action_handle_affirmation
```

`or` statements can be useful, but if you are using a
lot of them, it is probably better to restructure your domain and/or intents.
Overusing OR statements will slow down training.

## Test Conversation Format

The test conversation format is a format that combines both NLU data and stories
into a single file for evaluation. Read more about this format in [Testing Your Assistant](./testing-your-assistant.mdx).

:::caution testing only
This format is only used for testing and cannot be used for training.
