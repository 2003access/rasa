                 {core,nlu} ...

positional arguments:
  {core,nlu}
    core                Tests Rasa Core models using your test stories.
    nlu                 Tests Rasa NLU models using your test NLU data.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Path to a trained Rasa model. If a directory is
                        specified, it will use the latest model in this
                        directory. (default: models)
  --no-plot             Don't render evaluation plots. (default: False)
  --successes           If set successful predictions will be written to a
                        file. (default: False)
  --no-errors           If set incorrect predictions will NOT be written to a
                        file. (default: False)
  --out OUT             Output path for any files created during the
                        evaluation. (default: results)

Python Logging Options:
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose. Sets logging level to INFO. (default:
                        None)
  -vv, --debug          Print lots of debugging statements. Sets logging level
                        to DEBUG. (default: None)
  --quiet               Be quiet! Sets logging level to WARNING. (default:
                        None)

Core Test Arguments:
  -s STORIES, --stories STORIES
                        File or folder containing your test stories. (default:
                        tests)
  --max-stories MAX_STORIES
                        Maximum number of stories to test on. (default: None)
  --endpoints ENDPOINTS
                        Configuration file for the connectors as a yml file.
                        (default: None)
  --fail-on-prediction-errors
                        If a prediction error is encountered, an exception is
                        thrown. This can be used to validate stories during
                        tests, e.g. on travis. (default: False)
  --url URL             If supplied, downloads a story file from a URL and
                        trains on it. Fetches the data by sending a GET
                        request to the supplied URL. (default: None)
  --evaluate-model-directory
                        Should be set to evaluate models trained via 'rasa
                        train core --config <config-1> <config-2>'. All models
                        in the provided directory are evaluated and compared
                        against each other. (default: False)

NLU Test Arguments:
  -u NLU, --nlu NLU     File or folder containing your NLU data. (default:
                        data)
  -c CONFIG [CONFIG ...], --config CONFIG [CONFIG ...]
                        Model configuration file. If a single file is passed
                        and cross validation mode is chosen, cross-validation
                        is performed, if multiple configs or a folder of
                        configs are passed, models will be trained and
                        compared directly. (default: None)
