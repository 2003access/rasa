description: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that iterative improvements to your assistant are tested and deployed with minimum manual effort
abstract: Even though developing a contextual assistant is different from developing traditional
  software, you should still follow software development best practices.
  Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
  pipeline ensures that incremental updates to your bot are improving it, not harming it.

## Overview

Continous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging in code changes
frequently and automatically testing changes as they are committed. Continuous
Deployment (CD) means automatically deploying integrated changes to a staging
or production environment. Together, they allow you to make more frequent improvements
to your assistant and efficiently test and deploy those changes.

This guide will cover what should go in a CI/CD pipeline, specific to a
Rasa project. How you implement that pipeline is up to you.
There are many CI/CD tools out there, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
[GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/), and
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/). We recommend choosing a tool that integrates with
whatever Git repository you use.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The best way to improve an assistant is with frequent [incremental updates](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/fix-problems).
No matter how small a change is, you want to be sure that it doesn't introduce
new problems or negatively impact the performance of your assistant.

It is usually best to run CI checks on merge / pull requests or on commit. Most tests are
quick enough to run on every change. However, you can choose to run more
resource-intensive tests only when certain files have been changed or when some
other indicator is present. For example, if your code is hosted on Github,
you can make a test run only if the pull request has a certain label (e.g. “NLU testing required”).

### CI Pipeline Overview

There are different approaches to applying a CI pipeline depending on the number of changes.
All follow a mix of training the new model, testing to compare to older versions,
and setting up an easy CD pipeline to upload the new model.

The first step after saving new training data is to kick off the pipeline. (Is it usually kicked off
manually or triggered by an event like saving a new file?)
(need different pipelines / options based on how big the changes are - also should we lay out how
small or big of changes warrant which tests?) Typically this is done by xyz

Next, you need to pick what level of tests to run based on the amount of data changed. The various types
are laid out in [Testing Your Assistant](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/testing-your-assistant), but a good
rule of thumb is to always run your test stories to ensure no bugs were introduced. Larger changes
may need a full NLU test with cross validation to look out for confusion between intents.

After testing and posting your results for your team to see, have a person or team of reviewers
to check the test results with your developer. An easy process to help this is to have your CI
pipeline automatically create a pull request with the test results in a comment. That way, the
reviewer can see the changes along with the improved results.

Once the reviewer merges you can then initiate your CD pipeline to add the new model
to another environment.

### GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

You can use the [Rasa Train-Test Github Action](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-train-test-gha)
in your CI pipeline to automatically perform data validation, training, and testing.

An example CI pipeline using the Github Action is shown below:

```yaml
jobs:
  training-testing:
    name: Training and Testing
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Rasa Train and Test GitHub Action
        uses: RasaHQ/rasa-train-test-gha@main
        with:
          requirements_file: requirements.txt
          test_type: all
          cross_validation: true
          publish_summary: true
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Upload model
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: model
          path: models
```

In this pipeline, the Rasa Train-Test Github Action is performing data validation, model training, and story testing
in the first step and the model file is uploaded as an artifact in the second step.

The complete list of configurable parameters for the Rasa Train-Test Github Action is available in the repository's
[README](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-train-test-gha#input-arguments).

When `publish_summary` is set to `true`, this action will automatically publish the model's test results to the associated
Pull Request as a comment:

<img alt="image" src={useBaseUrl("/img/train-test-github-action.png")} />


## Continuous Deployment (CD)

To get improvements out to your users frequently, you will want to automate as
much of the deployment process as possible.

CD steps usually run on push or merge to a certain branch, once CI checks have
succeeded.

### Deploying Your Rasa Model

If you ran [test stories](#testing-your-assistant) in your CI pipeline,
you'll already have a trained model. You can set up your CD pipeline to upload the trained model to your
Rasa server if the CI results are satisfactory. For example, to upload a model to Rasa X:

```bash
curl -k -F "model=@models/my_model.tar.gz" "https://example.rasa.com/api/projects/default/models?api_token={your_api_token}"
```

If you are using Rasa X, you can also [tag the uploaded model](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/pages/http-api/#tag/Models/paths/~1projects~1{project_id}~1models~1{model}~1tags~1{tag}/put)
as production (or whichever deployment you want to tag if using multiple [deployment environments](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/enterprise/deployment-environments/#)):

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://example.rasa.com/api/projects/default/models/my_model/tags/production"
```

:::caution updates to action code
If your update includes changes to both your model and your action
code, and these changes depend on each other in any way, you should **not**
automatically tag the model as `production`. You will first need to build and
deploy your updated action server, so that the new model won't e.g. call
actions that don't exist in the pre-update action server.
:::


### Deploying Your Action Server

You can automate
[building and uploading a new image for your action server](./how-to-deploy.mdx#building-an-action-server-image)
to an image repository for each
update to your action code. As noted above, be careful with
automatically deploying a new image tag to production if the action server
would be incompatible with the current production model.

## Example CI/CD pipelines

As examples, see the CI/CD pipelines for
[Sara](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml),
the Rasa assistant that you can talk to in the Rasa Docs, and
[Carbon Bot](https://github.com/RasaHQ/carbon-bot/blob/master/.github/workflows/model_ci.yml).
Both use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a CI/CD tool.

These examples are just two of many possibilities. If you have a CI/CD setup you like, please
share it with the Rasa community on the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com).
