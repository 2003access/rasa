Replace `weight_sparsity` with `connection_density` in TED and DIET and add guarantees about internal layers.

We rename `DenseWithSparseWeights` into `RandomlyConnectedDense`, and guarantee that even at density zero the output is dense and every input is connected to at least one output. The former `weight_sparsity` parameter is now roughly equivalent to `1 - connection_density`, except at very low densities (high sparsities).
