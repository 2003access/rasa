- [#7196](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/issues/7196): Add support for OpenTracing with Jaeger

To enable the tracing, add the following block to your `endpoints.yml` replacing the name of the `agent_host` and `agent_port` with your Jaeger endpoint:

```yml
tracing:
  service_name: rasa
  agent_host: jaeger
  agent_port: 6831
```
