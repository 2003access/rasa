Load HuggingFace models in `LanguageModelFeaturizer` using `AutoTokenizer` and `TFAutoModel` classes. 
This enables the use of arbitrary models from the [Huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) instead 
of a hard-coded list of available architectures before. The default weights for the existing list of models are 
kept for backward compatibility.
